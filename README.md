# Apache-Tomcat-Deployment-on-AWS-EC2
This project demonstrates how to deploy and run an **Apache Tomcat 10** application server on an **AWS EC2 Linux instance**. The goal was to host a Java web application in the cloud and make it accessible over the internet

 Technologies Used
- **AWS EC2** – Virtual server to host the application
- **Amazon Linux** – Operating system for the EC2 instance
- **Apache Tomcat 10** – Java application server
- **Java (OpenJDK)** – Required to run Tomcat
- **VS Code** – Code editor and remote file management
- **SSH** – Secure connection to the EC2 instance

 What I Did
- Launched an **EC2 instance** on AWS
- Connected to the instance using **SSH**
- Installed **Java and Apache Tomcat**
- Configured **security group rules** to allow traffic on port `8080`
- Created and deployed a **ROOT web application**
- Verified server availability through a web browser
- Used **VS Code** to edit files and manage the server efficiently
